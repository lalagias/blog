Networking is broken.

We’ve all been there: you walk into a conference, a meetup, or an invite-only gathering, and you’re scanning the room blindly. You might have a guest list, but it's usually just a raw PDF or a scrolling Luma page — unstructured, disconnected, and useless for actual prioritization.

I built [**WhoIsAt.app**](https://whoisat.app) because I wanted to see if we could do better.

WhoIsAt isn’t a CRM. It’s not a lead-gen tool. It’s an exploration of **people intelligence for events**. 

The goal is simple: what if you understood exactly who was in the room, why they might be relevant to you, and what conversations you should prioritize — all before you even arrive?

## The Core Problem: Signal vs. Noise

Events are full of signal, but we rarely see it. Most networking is driven by luck or awkward randomness. Guest lists exist, but they are "dumb" data. 

WhoIsAt explores a simple shift: **Structured data over chaos.**

By extracting attendee lists from event pages and invitations, we can begin to layer on context that matters:
- Who are these people?
- What have they built?
- Why does their company align with your current interests?
- How can we cluster them so you aren't just looking at an alphabetical list?

## The Tech: Under the Hood

The product is built as an experiment-first tool. No fixed UI assumptions, no heavy dashboards. Just insights.

Technically, it runs on a multi-agent orchestration flow that I've been refining. When a list of names comes in (often scraped from Luma or manually dropped), it triggers a sequential pipeline:

1. **Discovery Agent**: Identifies the primary company and online presence for the individual.
2. **Profile Agent**: Deep-dives into the company context — industry, size, recent trajectory.
3. **Person Agent**: Pinpoints the specific role, seniority, and public background (LinkedIn, etc.).
4. **Scoring Agent**: This is where the magic happens. Based on your specific "persona" or goals, it calculates a fit score and provides a reasoning block.

It’s less about "data enrichment" and more about **intent-driven discovery**.

## Builder-Driven, Not Sales-Driven

The tone of WhoIsAt is deliberately anti-hustle. I’m not building this to help people spam more LinkedIn invites. I'm building it for founders, operators, and builders who value their time and want meaningful connections.

We don't need more "networking." We need more **intentional conversations**.

## What’s Next?

WhoIsAt is still in the "experiment" phase. I'm playing with conversational interfaces — imagine asking an AI, "Who here is building in the AI infrastructure space and has raised a Seed round?" and getting a curated, reasoned list in seconds.

The vision is a future where in-person interactions are smarter, calmer, and more intentional. 

Less "pitching," more building.
