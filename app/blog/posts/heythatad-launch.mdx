summary: "Over a weekend, I built **HeyThatAd**, a creative ad generator inspired by winning visual ads online. While I wait for GPT-4o image generation API to open up, the product already works manually â€” and it's live for $3. Here's how I built it with Cursor, Supabase, and Next.js."

Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹

I spent last weekend in flow mode â€” and the result is [**HeyThatAd**](https://heythatad.com), a simple but powerful tool to browse winning ad creatives and generate your own versions using AI.

Exceptâ€¦ the AI part is waiting for **ChatGPT 4o** to drop its image generation API. So for now? It works manually.  
And honestly, that's part of the fun.

## What is HeyThatAd?

HeyThatAd is a lightweight tool that lets you:

- Explore a curated feed of high-performing ad creatives from across the internet
- Click "Remix"
- Upload your product image, tagline, and brand name
- (Soon) get an AI-generated ad version styled after the original

I call it the **"Dupe Engine" for ads**.

The vision is simple: no more blank canvases. Just find a vibe that works, and remix it with your own brand.

## Why I built it

A tweet from [Cody Schneider](https://twitter.com/codyschneiderxx). X community talked about how game-changing GPT-4o's image generation is for ad creative workflows.

I didn't wait. I just built the tool manually, so that when the API opens â€” I'm already ahead.

> "Manual now. Auto later. Momentum always."

## How I built it (tech & stack)

**Editor**: Cursor  
**Stack**: Next.js (App Router), Supabase, Shadcn/ui, Tailwind  
**Auth + Storage**: Supabase  
**AI boilerplate**: Vercel AI SDK (plug-and-play ready once GPT-4o image API launches)

The scrapers were built in Puppeteer and dropped into a Supabase pipeline. UI was shipped fast with shadcn/ui. Everything is wired to flip to AI the moment the image gen SDK is public.

## Why it costs $3

People literally asked me to price it. So I did.  
$3 filters out noise, pays for hosting, and gives me signal.  
It also buys you early access to something I fully intend to grow once GPT-4o opens the gates.

## This is the start

This isn't a finished product. It's an early unlock of a powerful idea.

In the coming weeks:

- Full GPT-4o integration
- Brand kits and presets
- Public gallery of user-generated creatives
- AI remix engine for different industries

## Final thoughts

This was one of those "flow state" builds where everything aligned.  
The tweet. The tools. The timing. And the energy to just ship something.

You can try it here:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://heythatad.com](https://heythatad.com)

I'm shipping fast, testing demand, and staying ready for when the full stack unlocks.

Until next time,
