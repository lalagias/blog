Most people walk into events blind.

They have a guest list. A PDF. A Luma page.

None of it tells them who matters.

[**WhoIsAt**](https://whoisat.app) turns attendee lists into ranked profiles.

Not a CRM. Not lead-gen.

Structured context on who's in the room and why they're relevant to you.

---

## The Problem

Networking is random by default.

Guest lists exist but carry no signal.

You're left scanning a room hoping to get lucky.

Luck is not a strategy.

---

## How It Works

A list of names goes in.

Four agents run in sequence:

1. **Discovery** — finds company and online presence.
2. **Profile** — pulls company context: size, industry, trajectory.
3. **Person** — role, seniority, public background.
4. **Scoring** — calculates fit based on your goals. Returns a score and reasoning.

Output: a ranked list of who to talk to and why.

## Why

I kept wasting time at events.

Talking to people who were fine but irrelevant.

If you're going to show up, know why you're there.

---

## Status

Experimenting with conversational queries.

"Who here is building AI infra and raised a Seed?"

No roadmap.
